- Domain name (recommended: jamconst.com)
- SSH key pair for server access
- Email account for receiving leads

## Part 1: Oracle Cloud Deployment

### Step 1: Create Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

1. **Sign up for Oracle Cloud**
   - Visit: https://oracle.com/cloud/free
   - Create account (includes $300 free credits + Always Free resources)
   - Complete email verification

2. **Create Compute Instance**
   ```
   Navigate to: Compute > Instances > Create Instance
   
   Configuration:
   - Name: jam-construction-web
   - Shape: VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro (Always Free)
   - Image: Oracle Linux 8
   - Boot volume: 50GB (default)
   - SSH Keys: Upload your public key or generate new ones
   - Network: Use default VCN (Virtual Cloud Network)
   ```

3. **Configure Security Lists**
   ```
   Navigate to: Networking > Virtual Cloud Networks > Your VCN > Security Lists > Default Security List
   
   Add Ingress Rules:
   - Source: 0.0.0.0/0, Protocol: TCP, Port: 80 (HTTP)
   - Source: 0.0.0.0/0, Protocol: TCP, Port: 443 (HTTPS)
   - Source: Your IP/32, Protocol: TCP, Port: 22 (SSH)
   ```

### Step 2: Server Setup & Website Deployment

1. **Connect to Your Instance**
   ```bash
   # Get your instance's public IP from Oracle Cloud Console
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-private-key opc@YOUR_INSTANCE_IP
   ```

2. **Upload Website Files**
   ```bash
   # From your local machine (new terminal):
   scp -i ~/.ssh/your-private-key -r /Users/kofiarcher/Documents/JAM/* opc@YOUR_INSTANCE_IP:/home/opc/
   
   # Upload deployment script:
   scp -i ~/.ssh/your-private-key /Users/kofiarcher/Documents/JAM/oracle-deployment-script.sh opc@YOUR_INSTANCE_IP:/home/opc/
   ```

3. **Run Automated Deployment**
   ```bash
   # On your server:

   - Create A record: www.jamconst.com â†’ YOUR_INSTANCE_IP
   
   Wait for DNS propagation (2-48 hours)
   ```

2. **Install SSL Certificate**
   ```bash
   # After DNS propagation is complete:
   sudo certbot --apache -d jamconst.com -d www.jamconst.com
   
   # Follow prompts:
   # - Enter email address
   # - Agree to terms
   # - Choose redirect option (recommended)
   ```

3. **Test Your Website**
   ```bash
   # Check HTTP (should redirect to HTTPS):

   # Check HTTPS:
   curl -I https://jamconst.com
   
   # Check SSL certificate:
   openssl s_client -connect jamconst.com:443 -servername jamconst.com
